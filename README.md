# IT300-DAA-Project---Implementation of christofides algorithm

The following instruction shows how to compile and executes the file.

TSP using dynamic programing is used to compare the results.

Script is written in a python file, which, when executed, runs the christofides algorithm and TSP dynamic programming problem on 2 testcases. `input` folder contains 5 test inputs, but due to the large time complexity of the dynamic programming solution, we have only included two testcases in the script. It can be changed in the `main.py` file in the `inputFileNames` list.
